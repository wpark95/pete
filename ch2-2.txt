--- The neighborhood is dark and quite. You are the only person on the road.
--- You park your car in front of the Petersons residence.
--- You take a deep breath, and knock on the door.
You: "Hi, I'm Detective user_name from HPD. How are-"
Mr. Peterson: "I just got off the phone with one of your guys! My boy- Is Pete okay?"
You: "We're still looking for Pete at the moment."
--- Pete's parents break down in tears. You try to comfort them. Their neighbor's dogs start barking.
--- Mrs. Peterson invites you in. You talk to them for a while, and learn that Pete called his mother last night.
Mrs. Peterson: "He said he is meeting with someone. A friend from work."
You: "Did he tell you who he's meeting exactly?"
Mrs. Peterson: "No, he just said she's a friend from work."
You: "She?"
