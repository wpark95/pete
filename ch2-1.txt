--- You park your car on the street, and start staring at an old apartment building outside of your foggy car window.
--- As you walk into the building, the hallway is dead silent, except for the wooden floor creaking as you walk. 
--- You get to the end of the hallway, and stand in front of a door that says [109].
--- You think about drawing your handgun for a bit, but decide not to. Then you try to turn the door knob.
--- The door is locked. You feel a sense of relief, for some reason. You walk outside and call Z.
You: "Hey Z, I'm at Pete's apartment building. No, the door's locked."
--- After a while, the apartment manager arrives. 
Manager: "Hi, I'm Andy. You must be Detective user_name."
--- You talk to Andy and Pete's neighbors for a few hours, but nobody seems to know Pete very well.
--- You also check Pete's apartment room briefly, but the room is empty except for a few unpacked moving boxes.
--- After thanking the manager, you sit in your car for a while, staring at the apartment building.
