--- You are looking at a map on your office wall.
--- Someone walks into your office. It's Detective Z.
Z: "Looking for a breakfast place?"
You: "Z, Pete's neighbors didn't know him very well. The apartment manager said he only met him once when he moved in."
Z: "Perfect! So I'll just tell chief we have no clue then. I hate this job anyways, you know?"
You: "Did someone talk to Pete's parents already?"
Z: "They called us almost right after you left. They're flying to San Francisco as we speak."
You: "San Francisco? What's in San Francisco?"
Z: "Pete's younger brother. They think someone's after their family."
You: "What? Why would they think that?"
Z: "Apparently, Pete's father is a former DEA guy. He thinks this whole situation might be gang-related. A retaliation."
You: "Is that why those guys are here?"
--- You point towards a group of people wearing blue FBI jacket in the hallway.
