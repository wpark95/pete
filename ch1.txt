--- It's still dark in Hershey. The air is unusually cold, and, for some reason, feels heavy.
--- You walk past police vehicles surrounding the parking lot.
--- You see Z standing next to a car.
You: "What do we have here?"
Z: "Someone called 911 an hour ago. They heard a gunshot in this parking lot."
You: "Someone got shot?"
Z: "Negative. No bullet holes, no blood, no nothing..."
Z: "... But we found this car with its lights on. And 8 million dollars in its trunk. All cash."
You: "What the... 8 million? In cash? Jeff Bezos is in town?"
Z: "The car is registered to a guy named Pete Peterson. He moved to Hummelstown two weeks ago from California."
You: "Where is he now?"
Z: "We're trying to locate him."
You: "And what about the caller? Who called 911?"
Z: "We're still trying to identify them. Sergeant Jones is on it."
You: "I'll go to Hummelstown and see if I can find something there."
Z: "Not right now. Chief wants you to go talk to Pete's parents in Harrisburg."
