Z: "Who's this?"
You: "I talked to Pete's parents. Pete was supposed to meet a co-worker last night."
Z: "A co-worker?"
You: "Yes. A female. And I just talked to Pete's boss, there is only one female in his team. This is her."
Z: "Linda Jorgensen... See if we can talk to her."
You: "I already did. I'm supposed to meet her in 20 minutes. I'll keep you posted."
