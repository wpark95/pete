--- You are sitting in front of your computer. Someone's profile on your screen.
--- Detective Z walks in.
Z: "Who's this?"
You: "I talked to Pete's parents. Pete was supposed to meet a co-worker last night."
Z: "A co-worker?"
You: "Yes. A female. And I just talked to Pete's boss, there is only one female in his team. This is her."
Z: "Linda Jorgensen... Good. See if we can talk to her."
You: "Will do. Any updates from Jones?"
Z: "The person who called 911 used a burner phone. We're trying to see if we can track them down."
